Contacular is an open-source, object orientated contact form creation system developed in PHP.

The aim of Contacular is to be used as either a complete PHP contact form system or as a powerful code base for web developers to work from. Contacular is very simple to integrate, and also quite powerful, allowing a web developer to generate a fully functional contact form with advanced validation, e-mailing and error reporting in very few lines of code.
